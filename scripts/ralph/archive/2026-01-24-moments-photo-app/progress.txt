## Codebase Patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling (configured in tailwind.config.js)
- Environment variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to client-side code
- Convex functions go in the convex/ directory
- ABOUTME comments at the start of each file explain its purpose
- Tailwind v4 is installed but using v3-style config (tailwind.config.js + postcss.config.js)
- Run `npm run check` before committing (typecheck + tests)
- Tests: `convex/*.test.ts` for backend, `src/**/*.test.tsx` for components
- Use convex-test for Convex function tests, @testing-library/react for UI

## 2026-01-24 21:38 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created Vite + React + TypeScript project scaffold
  - Configured Tailwind CSS with tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js
  - Initialized Convex directory structure with placeholder schema
  - Installed UploadThing dependencies (uploadthing, @uploadthing/react)
  - Created .env.example documenting required environment variables
  - Added ConvexProvider wrapper in main.tsx
- Files changed:
  - package.json (project config, dependencies, scripts)
  - tailwind.config.js (Tailwind configuration)
  - postcss.config.js (PostCSS with Tailwind/autoprefixer)
  - src/main.tsx (React entry with Convex provider)
  - src/App.tsx (Basic app component with Tailwind styling)
  - src/index.css (Global CSS with Tailwind directives)
  - convex/schema.ts (Empty Convex schema placeholder)
  - convex/_generated/api.d.ts (Type placeholder for Convex API)
  - .env.example (Environment variable documentation)
  - index.html (Updated title to PhotoSpot)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind v4 uses different init commands - `npx tailwindcss init` may not work, create config files manually
  - VITE_CONVEX_URL env var is used for the Convex client connection
  - UploadThing requires both `uploadthing` and `@uploadthing/react` packages
