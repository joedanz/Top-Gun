## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npm run check` to run typecheck + tests together
- Babylon.js mocks in tests need `class` syntax (not arrow functions) for Vitest 4 constructors
- Use `await import("@babylonjs/core")` (not `require`) to access mocked modules in test assertions
- Port 5173+ may be occupied by other Vite apps; check output for actual port assigned
- Game class pattern: constructor takes canvas, initializes Engine → Scene → Camera → Light → meshes

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- What was implemented: Vite + TypeScript + Babylon.js project bootstrap with WASD-movable cube
- Files changed: package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, index.html, .gitignore, src/main.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 7 new tests in src/Game.test.ts (3 scene setup + 4 movement)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Babylon.js uses `@babylonjs/core` modular imports (not monolithic `babylonjs`)
  - Vitest 4 requires class-based mocks for anything used with `new`
  - `Vector3.Zero()` is a static method — mocks need `Object.assign` or class statics
  - jsdom environment works for unit testing game logic but can't test WebGL rendering
