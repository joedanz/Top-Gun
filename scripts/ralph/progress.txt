## Codebase Patterns
- Aircraft data lives in `public/data/aircraft.json` — served as static asset, fetched at runtime via `loadAircraftCatalog()`
- `Aircraft.flightParams` is optional — when set, FlightSystem uses it instead of system-wide defaults
- `AircraftData.ts` has module-level state (`catalog`); tests must call `resetCatalog()` in `beforeEach`
- Use `npm run check` to run typecheck + tests together
- Babylon.js mocks in tests need `class` syntax (not arrow functions) for Vitest 4 constructors
- Use `await import("@babylonjs/core")` (not `require`) to access mocked modules in test assertions
- Port 5173+ may be occupied by other Vite apps; check output for actual port assigned
- Game class pattern: constructor takes canvas, initializes Engine → Scene → Camera → Light → meshes
- FlightInput interface decouples input from entities — Aircraft reads from FlightInput, not keyboard
- Mock Scene constructor needs cast: `new (Scene as unknown as new () => Scene)()` for typecheck
- Default GitHub PR base may not be `master` — always use `--base master` with `gh pr create`
- ECS-like pattern: entities hold state, systems operate on entities (FlightSystem updates Aircraft)
- `@babylonjs/gui` mocks also need class syntax for StackPanel, Slider, TextBlock (used with `new`)
- FlightSystem.params is mutable — DebugPanel sliders write directly to it for real-time tuning
- Use `vi.hoisted()` for mock functions referenced inside `vi.mock()` factories (hoisting issue)
- Skybox uses `infiniteDistance = true` so it always renders behind everything
- Terrain at 4000x4000 units is large enough for extended flight without reaching edges
- FlightInput interface now includes `fire: boolean` and `cycleTarget: boolean` — all mock inputs must include both
- ScreenShake tests need deterministic `Math.random` mock to avoid flaky magnitude comparisons
- `Ellipse` from `@babylonjs/gui` needs class-style mock (used by TargetingSystem reticle/lead marker)
- Projectile direction uses same math as FlightSystem: `sin(rotY)` for X, `cos(rotY)` for Z
- AIInput implements FlightInput with mutable fields — AISystem writes, Aircraft reads
- Aircraft constructor accepts optional name and color options for distinguishing enemy meshes
- `Math.atan2(dx, dz)` gives desired yaw toward a target in Babylon's coordinate system
- Normalize angle diff to [-PI, PI] with while loops for correct shortest-path turning
- Aircraft has `health` (number) and `alive` (boolean) — systems should check `alive` before operating
- CollisionSystem uses owner-pair pattern to prevent self-hits from own weapon system
- ParticleSystem mock needs class syntax with all fields (emitter, sizes, colors, etc.)
- `Rectangle` from `@babylonjs/gui` needs class-style mock (used by HitFlash in Game.test.ts)
- Camera shake: apply additive offset AFTER CameraSystem.update() positions the camera
- `Rectangle` with `cornerRadius` makes circular radar background; use `addControl` to nest blips inside
- Heading-up radar: rotate relative positions by `cos(heading)/sin(heading)` (positive heading, not negated)
- Adding a field to FlightInput requires updating mock input objects in ALL test files (Aircraft, Camera, Collision, Flight, Weapon, Targeting)
- `Ellipse.addControl` needed in GUI mocks when nesting TextBlock inside an Ellipse (lock indicator pattern)
- Edge-triggered fire for missiles: track `prevFire` to detect press vs hold
- Lock cone check: `Math.acos(dot / dist)` gives angle between player forward and target direction
- MissionLoader is a static factory: `MissionLoader.load(missionData, scene)` returns all spawned entities
- ObjectiveManager tracks kills via `recordKill()` and time via `update(dt)`, reports `outcome` as getter
- Mission JSON files live in `public/missions/` — fetched at runtime, not bundled as imports
- Mock `CreateCylinder` must return a NEW object per call (not spread of shared template) to avoid shared position refs
- HTML/CSS overlays (BriefingScene pattern): create div with `position:absolute;inset:0;z-index:100`, dispose removes from DOM
- Scene transition flow: main.ts fetches mission JSON → BriefingScene overlay → onLaunch callback disposes overlay and creates Game
- Game constructor takes `(canvas, MissionData, onMissionEnd)` — mission data drives ObjectiveManager and enemy spawns
- Game.dispose() stops render loop, disposes engine and InputManager — required for clean scene transitions
- Kill tracking: check `!enemy.alive` in render loop; use a counter to avoid double-counting
- Mission end: check ObjectiveManager.outcome + CollisionSystem.missionFailed each frame, fire callback once via `missionEnded` flag
- MissionResult interface lives in DebriefScene.ts — exported for Game.ts to use
- Game constructor signature: `(canvas, MissionData, onMissionEnd, aircraftId?)` — aircraftId applies per-aircraft stats
- Scene flow in main.ts: briefing → hangar → fly → debrief (hangar inserted between briefing and game)
- Node.js 22+ built-in `localStorage` lacks `getItem`/`setItem`/`clear` — SaveManager uses injectable `Storage` interface for testability
- SaveManager uses versioned key `topgun_save_v1` — bump version number for breaking schema changes
- ProgressionManager reads/writes via SaveManager — constructor loads state, mutations auto-save
- Theater-based aircraft unlocks: pacific → fa-18, middleeast → p-51
- Sequential mission unlock: completing `pacific-01` unlocks `pacific-02` (MISSION_ORDER array in ProgressionManager)
- FormationSystem manages wing/diamond formations; `FormationSpawn` in MissionData maps enemy indices to formation roles
- Formation engagement uses hysteresis: engage at 500 units, disengage at 800 units to prevent flapping
- Wingman offsets are rotated by leader heading for world-space positioning
- AISystem constructor takes optional `difficulty` (1-3); maneuver repertoire scales with difficulty
- `MissionData.aiDifficulty` configures AI difficulty per mission (defaults to 1)
- WeaponManager orchestrates all weapon types — wraps WeaponSystem (guns) and MissileLockSystem (heat-seeking)
- `cycleWeapon` (X key) cycles through weapon types: Guns → HeatSeeking → RadarGuided → Rockets → Bombs
- Adding a field to FlightInput requires updating type annotations AND mock objects in ALL test files
- Rocket entity: unguided, 350 speed, 3s lifetime, 35 damage — good for burst fire at ground targets
- Bomb entity: gravity-affected (30 units/s²), inherits aircraft forward velocity, 80 damage, detonates at ground level
- Missile `mode` param ("heat" | "radar"): heat=8s lifetime, radar=12s lifetime (fire-and-forget, longer range)
- `Hittable` interface in CollisionSystem: any entity with `mesh.position`, `alive`, `damage` can collide with aircraft
- `CollisionSystem.checkHittables()` handles rockets/bombs/missiles — separate from gun projectile checking
- WeaponLoadout extended: `radarMissiles?`, `rockets?`, `bombs?` (optional for backward compat)
- Game.ts uses `weaponManager` instead of separate `weaponSystem` + `missileLockSystem`
- HUD shows `WPN: <label>` and `AMMO: <count>` for the active weapon type
- `Missile.divertToFlare(pos)` redirects a missile toward a flare position — nulls the target reference
- CountermeasureSystem alternates flare/chaff on each F key press; falls back if one type is depleted
- Flare decoy uses probabilistic check (`Math.random() < threshold`) — mock Math.random for deterministic tests
- `deployCountermeasure` field added to FlightInput — F key in InputManager
- GroundTarget uses CreateBox mesh; SAM type fires Missile via `tryFire(scene, targetPos, dt)` with cooldown
- `CollisionSystem.checkGroundTargets()` returns destroyed indices — caller records ground kills via ObjectiveManager
- `ObjectiveManager(objectives, totalEnemies, totalGroundTargets)` — 3rd param optional for backward compat
- MissionData `groundTargets?: GroundTargetSpawn[]` — optional array of `{type, position}` objects
- `destroy_ground_targets` objective type uses `recordGroundKill()` and counts against `totalGroundTargets`
- MenuScene follows same HTML/CSS overlay pattern as BriefingScene/DebriefScene
- SettingsScene persists to separate `topgun_settings_v1` localStorage key (not inside SaveManager)
- `loadSettings(storage?)` / `saveSettings(settings, storage?)` accept injectable storage for testability
- DebriefScene "Return to Menu" now goes to showMenu() instead of looping back to briefing
- MissionManifest (`src/MissionManifest.ts`) holds static mission metadata (id, title, jsonPath) per theater — use for UI without fetching JSONs
- CAMPAIGN_THEATERS array in MissionManifest and THEATER_MISSIONS in ProgressionManager must stay in sync
- TheaterSelectScene takes `TheaterInfo[]` — build via `buildTheaterInfos()` in main.ts using ProgressionManager
- Scene flow: menu → theater select → briefing → hangar → fly → debrief → theater select (or menu)
- `Scoring.ts` has standalone `calculateScore()` and `getMedal()` — used by both Game.ts and ProgressionManager
- `MissionResult` has score, medal, shotsFired, shotsHit, damageTaken — all test MissionResult objects must include these fields
- `WeaponSystem.shotsFired` tracks gun rounds fired; `CollisionSystem.playerHitsDealt` tracks hits on enemies
- `MissionInfo.medal` field required in TheaterSelectScene — pass via `progression.getMissionMedal(id)` in buildTheaterInfos()
- Boss missions use `bossIndex`, `bossName`, `bossHealth` in MissionData — all optional for backward compat
- BossSystem phases: Normal (>50% HP), Enraged (≤50%), Desperate (≤25%) — `aggressionModifier` scales per phase
- BossHealthBar is a separate AdvancedDynamicTexture — call `show(name)` to activate, `update(ratio)` each frame
- Game.bossSystem is null for non-boss missions — check `mission.bossIndex !== undefined` before initializing
- `@babylonjs/loaders` must be installed and imported (`import "@babylonjs/loaders/glTF"`) for GLTF/GLB loading
- AssetLoader caches loaded meshes by path — load once, apply to multiple aircraft if needed
- GLTF meshes are scene-bound — AssetLoader must use the Game's scene, not a temporary one
- `AircraftStats.modelPath` is optional — aircraft without models gracefully use placeholder cone mesh
- `vi.hoisted()` required for mock functions referenced inside `vi.mock()` factory (used in AssetLoader.test.ts)
- Babylon.js `Sound` uses `setPlaybackRate()` method (not a `playbackRate` property) for pitch modulation
- Audio files live in `public/audio/` — served as static assets, referenced by relative path in Sound constructor
- `Sound` constructor: `new Sound(name, url, scene, readyCallback, options)` — readyCallback can be null
- Track firing events via count comparison (`prevShotsFired` vs current) rather than callback hooks
- MockSound in Game.test.ts needs `setPlaybackRate` method for AudioManager integration

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- What was implemented: Vite + TypeScript + Babylon.js project bootstrap with WASD-movable cube
- Files changed: package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, index.html, .gitignore, src/main.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 7 new tests in src/Game.test.ts (3 scene setup + 4 movement)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Babylon.js uses `@babylonjs/core` modular imports (not monolithic `babylonjs`)
  - Vitest 4 requires class-based mocks for anything used with `new`
  - `Vector3.Zero()` is a static method — mocks need `Object.assign` or class statics
  - jsdom environment works for unit testing game logic but can't test WebGL rendering
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-002
- What was implemented: InputManager (keyboard → semantic axes) and Aircraft entity (cylinder mesh driven by FlightInput)
- Files changed: src/InputManager.ts, src/InputManager.test.ts, src/Aircraft.ts, src/Aircraft.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 18 new tests (12 InputManager + 6 Aircraft), Game tests updated to 5 (total 23)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - FlightInput interface allows swapping input sources (keyboard, AI, network) without changing Aircraft
  - MeshBuilder.CreateCylinder with diameterTop=0 makes a cone shape (good aircraft placeholder)
  - GitHub default branch may differ from master — always specify `--base master` in `gh pr create`
  - Aircraft rotation.x = PI/2 points the cone forward (Babylon cylinders are Y-up by default)
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-003
- What was implemented: FlightSystem with velocity-based arcade movement, speed-dependent turning, stall/recovery, altitude floor, and DebugPanel with Babylon GUI sliders
- Files changed: src/FlightSystem.ts, src/FlightSystem.test.ts, src/DebugPanel.ts, src/DebugPanel.test.ts, src/Aircraft.ts, src/Aircraft.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 16 new tests (12 FlightSystem + 4 DebugPanel), Aircraft tests updated to 4, Game tests updated to 6 (total 38)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Aircraft.update() was removed — movement logic now lives in FlightSystem (ECS pattern)
  - Aircraft.input changed from `private` to `readonly` so systems can read it
  - Speed-dependent turn rate: `speedFactor = 1 - (speed/maxSpeed) * 0.7` gives a nice curve
  - Stall recovery: nose drops (rotation.x increases) and speed recovers automatically
  - DebugPanel uses AdvancedDynamicTexture.CreateFullscreenUI for screen-space GUI overlay
  - Babylon GUI Slider.onValueChangedObservable.add() for reactive parameter binding
  - CameraSystem uses lerp interpolation with configurable smoothing factor
  - Remove `camera.attachControl()` when using a custom CameraSystem to avoid input conflicts
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-004
- What was implemented: CameraSystem with smooth third-person chase camera, speed-dependent distance, and lerp interpolation
- Files changed: src/CameraSystem.ts, src/CameraSystem.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 6 new tests (5 CameraSystem + 1 Game), total now 44
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - FreeCamera.attachControl must be removed when CameraSystem manages positioning — otherwise built-in controls fight with custom logic
  - Lerp smoothing factor of 0.05 gives a nice smooth follow without feeling laggy
  - Speed-dependent distance formula: `baseDistance + (speed/maxSpeed) * speedDistanceScale`
  - Mock FreeCamera needs position as MockVector3 (with x/y/z), not a plain object
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-005
- What was implemented: Terrain class (4000x4000 textured ground plane) and Skybox class (large box with emissive gradient material, infinite distance)
- Files changed: src/Terrain.ts, src/Terrain.test.ts, src/Skybox.ts, src/Skybox.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 8 new tests (3 Terrain + 4 Skybox + 1 Game), total now 52
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `vi.hoisted()` is required when mock functions need to be referenced inside `vi.mock()` factory (Vitest hoists `vi.mock` calls above variable declarations)
  - Babylon.js `infiniteDistance = true` makes skybox always render behind everything
  - `StandardMaterial.backFaceCulling = false` needed for skybox so inside faces are visible
  - `StandardMaterial.disableLighting = true` + `emissiveColor` gives a flat unlit sky color
  - 4000x4000 terrain with 32 subdivisions provides good coverage without perf issues
  - `(mock.calls[0] as unknown[])[1]` cast needed for TypeScript when accessing mock call args
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-006
- What was implemented: Projectile entity (tracer mesh, forward movement, lifetime expiry), WeaponSystem (spawns projectiles from aircraft nose, rate-of-fire cooldown), fire key (Space) added to InputManager/FlightInput
- Files changed: src/Projectile.ts, src/Projectile.test.ts, src/WeaponSystem.ts, src/WeaponSystem.test.ts, src/InputManager.ts, src/InputManager.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, src/Aircraft.test.ts, src/CameraSystem.test.ts, src/FlightSystem.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 13 new tests (5 Projectile + 6 WeaponSystem + 1 InputManager fire + 1 Game), total now 65
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Adding a field to FlightInput requires updating ALL mock input objects across test files
  - Projectile uses same direction math as FlightSystem for consistency
  - WeaponSystem cooldown of 0.15s gives a good rate of fire (~6.7 rounds/sec)
  - `as never` cast works for passing partial mock objects to typed system methods in tests
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-007
- What was implemented: AIInput (mutable FlightInput for AI), AISystem (pursuit/firing/evasion), enemy Aircraft with red color, enemy WeaponSystem, Game integration
- Files changed: src/AIInput.ts, src/AIInput.test.ts, src/AISystem.ts, src/AISystem.test.ts, src/Aircraft.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 12 new tests (8 AISystem + 2 AIInput + 2 Game), total now 77
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Aircraft constructor now takes optional name and AircraftOptions (color) — backward compatible
  - AISystem.update takes `underFire` boolean — collision system will provide this in US-008
  - `Math.atan2(dx, dz)` gives desired yaw in Babylon's coordinate system (Z-forward)
  - Angle normalization to [-PI, PI] is critical for correct shortest-path steering
  - Enemy fires based on dot product angle check + distance — simple but effective
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-008
- What was implemented: CollisionSystem (bounding sphere projectile-aircraft collisions, damage, explosion VFX via ParticleSystem, ground collision detection, mission-failed state), Aircraft health/alive properties, FlightSystem skips dead aircraft, Game integration with owner-tracking to prevent self-hits, enemy underFire detection from nearby projectiles
- Files changed: src/CollisionSystem.ts, src/CollisionSystem.test.ts, src/Aircraft.ts, src/Aircraft.test.ts, src/FlightSystem.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 14 new tests (11 CollisionSystem + 2 Aircraft + 1 Game), total now 91
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Owner-pair pattern: pass `{ aircraft, weaponSystem }` pairs to CollisionSystem to prevent self-hits
  - Babylon.js ParticleSystem with `targetStopDuration` + `disposeOnStop` creates self-cleaning burst effects
  - FlightSystem should check `aircraft.alive` before updating — dead aircraft shouldn't fly
  - Ground collision at altitude floor (y=2) means aircraft at terrain level are destroyed
  - `underFire` detection: check if any enemy projectile is within 100 units of the aircraft
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-009
- What was implemented: ScreenShake (decaying random camera offsets on damage), HitFlash (red GUI rectangle overlay that fades), CollisionSystem `playerHitThisFrame` flag, Game integration applying shake offsets to camera and triggering flash on player hits
- Files changed: src/ScreenShake.ts, src/ScreenShake.test.ts, src/HitFlash.ts, src/HitFlash.test.ts, src/CollisionSystem.ts, src/CollisionSystem.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 14 new tests (5 ScreenShake + 5 HitFlash + 2 CollisionSystem + 2 Game), total now 105
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Exponential decay (`intensity *= Math.exp(-rate * dt)`) gives smooth, natural fade-out for screen effects
  - Camera shake is best applied as additive offset AFTER CameraSystem positions the camera
  - `Rectangle` from `@babylonjs/gui` needs class-style mock in Game.test.ts (like other GUI components)
  - `playerHitThisFrame` flag pattern keeps CollisionSystem decoupled from feedback systems
  - `isPointerBlocker = false` and `isHitTestVisible = false` on GUI overlays prevents them from eating input
- HUD uses `AdvancedDynamicTexture.CreateFullscreenUI` with a StackPanel for layout — same pattern as DebugPanel
- WeaponSystem has `ammo` field (default 200) — decrements on fire, stops firing at 0
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-010
- What was implemented: HUD class with speed, altitude, heading, ammo, and health text indicators using Babylon GUI; WeaponSystem ammo tracking (200 rounds, stops firing at 0); Game integration updating HUD each frame
- Files changed: src/Hud.ts, src/Hud.test.ts, src/WeaponSystem.ts, src/WeaponSystem.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 11 new tests (8 Hud + 2 WeaponSystem + 1 Game), total now 116
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HUD StackPanel at bottom-left with `VERTICAL_ALIGNMENT_BOTTOM` keeps it out of gameplay view
  - Green text (#00ff88) on dark background is readable without being distracting
  - Heading normalization: convert radians to degrees, mod 360, add 360 if negative
  - WeaponSystem ammo field is public for HUD to read — pass ammo count to `hud.update()`
  - Multiple AdvancedDynamicTexture fullscreen UIs can coexist (DebugPanel, HitFlash, HUD)
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-011
- What was implemented: TargetingSystem with target reticle (Ellipse overlay), lead indicator for deflection shooting, Tab key cycle-target, distance readout; InputManager cycleTarget via Tab; AIInput cycleTarget field; fixed flaky ScreenShake tests with deterministic Math.random mock
- Files changed: src/TargetingSystem.ts, src/TargetingSystem.test.ts, src/InputManager.ts, src/InputManager.test.ts, src/AIInput.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, src/ScreenShake.test.ts, src/Aircraft.test.ts, src/CameraSystem.test.ts, src/CollisionSystem.test.ts, src/FlightSystem.test.ts, src/WeaponSystem.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 10 new tests (8 TargetingSystem + 1 InputManager + 1 Game), total now 126
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Adding a field to FlightInput requires updating ALL mock input objects across ALL test files
  - Lead indicator uses frame-to-frame position delta to estimate target velocity, then projects forward by distance/bulletSpeed
  - `Ellipse` from `@babylonjs/gui` is a good shape for reticle/lead marker overlays
  - `WeakMap` works well for per-entity state that auto-cleans when entities are garbage collected
  - ScreenShake tests were flaky due to Math.random — fixed by mocking with deterministic sequence
  - Screen-space projection: project world pos to camera plane using dot products with camera right/up/forward vectors
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-012
- What was implemented: Radar class — 2D top-down minimap in bottom-right corner showing enemy (red) and friendly (green) blips relative to centered player dot (white), with heading-up rotation and range scaling
- Files changed: src/Radar.ts, src/Radar.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 10 new tests (9 Radar + 1 Game), total now 136
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `Rectangle` with `cornerRadius = size/2` creates a circular container for radar background
  - Heading-up rotation uses positive heading angle (not negated) with standard cos/sin rotation matrix
  - Blip pool pattern: grow pool lazily, hide excess blips — avoids creating/destroying GUI elements each frame
  - `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` background on Rectangle gives a nice semi-transparent radar overlay
  - Game.test.ts MockRectangle needed `cornerRadius`, `paddingRight`, `paddingTop`, `addControl` for Radar
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-013
- What was implemented: MissileLockSystem with state machine (Idle → Locking → Locked), Missile homing entity with limited turn rate, lock-on HUD indicator with progress %, R key for lock, missile ammo on HUD (MSL: 4), FlightInput lockOn field added
- Files changed: src/Missile.ts, src/Missile.test.ts, src/MissileLockSystem.ts, src/MissileLockSystem.test.ts, src/InputManager.ts, src/InputManager.test.ts, src/AIInput.ts, src/Hud.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, + 6 test files updated for lockOn field
- **Tests added:** 18 new tests (6 Missile + 10 MissileLockSystem + 1 InputManager + 1 Game), total now 154
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Adding a field to FlightInput requires updating ALL mock input objects across ALL test files — tedious but necessary
  - State machine pattern (enum + switch) is cleaner than boolean flags for multi-state systems like lock-on
  - Edge-triggered fire (`firePressed && !prevFire`) prevents continuous missile spam
  - Missile turn rate of 2.0 rad/s gives good gameplay — fast enough to track, slow enough to dodge
  - `Ellipse.addControl` must be in GUI mock when nesting TextBlock inside Ellipse
  - Lock cone of PI/6 (30°) half-angle feels right — not too generous, not too strict
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-014
- What was implemented: MissionData TypeScript interfaces, MissionLoader (static factory spawning player/enemies from JSON), ObjectiveManager (tracks destroy_enemies, destroy_all, survive_time objectives with success/failure outcome), example mission JSON (pacific-01)
- Files changed: src/MissionData.ts, src/MissionLoader.ts, src/MissionLoader.test.ts, src/ObjectiveManager.ts, src/ObjectiveManager.test.ts, public/missions/pacific-01.json
- **Tests added:** 16 new tests (10 ObjectiveManager + 6 MissionLoader), total now 170
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MissionLoader.load() is a static factory returning MissionEntities — keeps it stateless and testable
  - ObjectiveManager uses a getter `outcome` that derives state from kills/time/failed — no manual state transitions
  - Mock objects with shared nested references (e.g., position) cause tests to interfere — always create fresh objects per mock call
  - Mission JSON in public/ directory means it's served as static assets by Vite, fetchable at runtime
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-015
- What was implemented: BriefingScene (HTML/CSS overlay showing mission title, description, theater, objectives, and Launch button), main.ts updated to fetch mission JSON and show briefing before starting Game
- Files changed: src/BriefingScene.ts, src/BriefingScene.test.ts, src/main.ts
- **Tests added:** 8 new tests in src/BriefingScene.test.ts, total now 178
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HTML/CSS overlay approach is simpler than Babylon GUI for text-heavy UI screens (briefing, menus)
  - BriefingScene takes a container element + onLaunch callback — clean separation from game lifecycle
  - `dispose()` pattern with `this.overlay.remove()` ensures clean DOM teardown on scene transition
  - Many Vite dev servers may be running; check output for actual port assignment (can go up to 5189+)
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-016
- What was implemented: DebriefScene (HTML/CSS overlay showing kills, time, pass/fail, with Next Mission and Return to Menu buttons), Game integration with ObjectiveManager for kill tracking and mission end detection, Game.dispose() for clean teardown, main.ts full mission loop (briefing → fly → debrief → menu/next)
- Files changed: src/DebriefScene.ts, src/DebriefScene.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, src/main.ts
- **Tests added:** 12 new tests (10 DebriefScene + 2 Game), total now 190
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Game needs dispose() to clean up engine/input before transitioning scenes — otherwise render loop keeps running
  - Kill tracking via alive-flag check in render loop works but needs a counter to avoid double-counting
  - MissionResult interface exported from DebriefScene.ts — shared between Game and DebriefScene
  - main.ts orchestrates scene lifecycle via function calls (showBriefing, startMission, showDebrief) — no state machine needed yet
  - "Next Mission" and "Return to Menu" both go back to briefing for now — menu/campaign selection comes in later stories
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-017
- What was implemented: AircraftData module (types, catalog loader, registry), aircraft.json with 3 aircraft (F-14, P-51, F/A-18) with distinct stats, Aircraft.flightParams field, FlightSystem reads per-aircraft params
- Files changed: src/AircraftData.ts, src/AircraftData.test.ts, src/Aircraft.ts, src/FlightSystem.ts, src/FlightSystem.test.ts, public/data/aircraft.json
- **Tests added:** 10 new tests (8 AircraftData + 2 FlightSystem), total now 200
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Module-level state in AircraftData needs `resetCatalog()` for test isolation
  - `aircraft.flightParams ?? this.params` pattern lets FlightSystem gracefully handle aircraft with or without custom params
  - Static JSON in `public/data/` is served by Vite and fetchable at runtime — same pattern as mission JSON
  - WeaponLoadout in aircraft data includes gunAmmo and missiles — ready for HangarScene to use
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-018
- What was implemented: HangarScene (HTML/CSS overlay displaying aircraft cards with stats, select buttons, locked aircraft support), Game accepts optional aircraftId to apply per-aircraft flight params and weapon loadout, main.ts flow updated to briefing → hangar → fly → debrief
- Files changed: src/HangarScene.ts, src/HangarScene.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/main.ts
- **Tests added:** 7 new tests in src/HangarScene.test.ts, total now 207
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HangarScene follows same HTML/CSS overlay pattern as BriefingScene — dispose() removes overlay from DOM
  - Game constructor takes optional `aircraftId` as 4th param — applies stats via `getAircraftStats()` after all systems are initialized
  - `data-aircraft-id` attribute on cards enables querying specific aircraft cards in tests
  - Locked aircraft: pass `lockedIds` array, cards render with LOCKED label and no Select button
  - Aircraft catalog must be loaded before showing HangarScene — `loadAircraftCatalog()` in start()
  - Border highlight on selection: set `borderColor` to `rgb(0, 170, 0)` (green) and reset others
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-019
- What was implemented: SaveManager (localStorage persistence with versioned keys, corruption handling), ProgressionManager (score calculation, mission completion tracking, sequential mission unlocking, theater-based aircraft unlocking), main.ts integration passing locked aircraft IDs to HangarScene and recording mission completions
- Files changed: src/SaveManager.ts, src/SaveManager.test.ts, src/ProgressionManager.ts, src/ProgressionManager.test.ts, src/main.ts
- **Tests added:** 19 new tests (5 SaveManager + 14 ProgressionManager), total now 226
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Node.js 22+ has a built-in `localStorage` that lacks Web Storage API methods (`getItem`, `setItem`, `clear`) — need injectable Storage interface for tests
  - `vi.mock` doesn't help with Node's built-in localStorage proxy; mock storage objects are the clean solution
  - Score formula: kills * 500 + max(0, 1000 - time * 10) gives reasonable differentiation
  - MISSION_ORDER array defines sequential unlock — adding new missions requires updating this array
  - ProgressionManager auto-saves on every mutation via SaveManager.save()

## 2026-02-01 - US-020
- What was implemented: FormationSystem supporting wing pair and diamond formations with engagement/disengagement logic, FormationSpawn added to MissionData schema, Game integration with FormationSystem, pacific-01 updated with wing pair formation
- Files changed: src/FormationSystem.ts, src/FormationSystem.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, src/MissionData.ts, public/missions/pacific-01.json
- **Tests added:** 10 new tests (9 FormationSystem + 1 Game) in src/FormationSystem.test.ts and src/Game.test.ts, total now 236
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hysteresis pattern (different engage/disengage thresholds) prevents formation state flapping
  - Wingman offset rotation: rotate local offsets by leader heading using cos/sin for world-space positioning
  - FormationSystem.updateAll() runs before AISystem — when disengaged, formation overrides wingman input; when engaged, AISystem takes over
  - `FormationSpawn.members` indices reference the `enemies` array in MissionData — first index is leader
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-021
- What was implemented: AISystem evasive maneuvers (break turn, barrel roll, split-S) with difficulty scaling (1-3), maneuver duration/continuation across frames, low-altitude split-S avoidance, `aiDifficulty` field in MissionData, Game passes difficulty to AISystem
- Files changed: src/AISystem.ts, src/AISystem.test.ts, src/MissionData.ts, src/Game.ts, public/missions/pacific-01.json
- **Tests added:** 8 new tests (7 evasive maneuvers + 1 difficulty config) in src/AISystem.test.ts, total now 244
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Maneuver state machine: `activeManeuver` + `maneuverTimer` keeps the AI committed to a maneuver for its duration instead of re-rolling every frame
  - Split-S must be altitude-gated (MIN_SPLIT_S_ALTITUDE = 40) to prevent AI from diving into the ground
  - MANEUVERS_BY_DIFFICULTY lookup table cleanly maps difficulty levels to available maneuver repertoires
  - `maneuverDirection` (+1/-1) randomized at maneuver start gives variety without frame-to-frame randomness
  - Break turn uses yaw (not roll) for a hard heading change — distinct from barrel roll which uses roll
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-022
- What was implemented: Weapon variety — Rocket entity (unguided, burst fire), Bomb entity (gravity-affected), radar-guided missile mode on Missile, WeaponManager orchestrator with weapon cycling (X key), updated HUD with active weapon display, CollisionSystem.checkHittables() for new projectile types, WeaponLoadout extended with rockets/bombs/radarMissiles, aircraft.json updated with distinct loadouts per aircraft
- Files changed: src/Rocket.ts, src/Rocket.test.ts, src/Bomb.ts, src/Bomb.test.ts, src/WeaponManager.ts, src/WeaponManager.test.ts, src/Missile.ts, src/Missile.test.ts, src/Projectile.ts, src/CollisionSystem.ts, src/CollisionSystem.test.ts, src/InputManager.ts, src/InputManager.test.ts, src/AIInput.ts, src/AircraftData.ts, src/Hud.ts, src/Hud.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, public/data/aircraft.json, + 5 test files updated for cycleWeapon field
- **Tests added:** 32 new tests (7 Rocket + 8 Bomb + 4 Missile radar + 9 WeaponManager + 3 HUD weapon + 1 InputManager), total now 276
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - WeaponManager wraps existing systems rather than replacing them — minimizes refactoring risk
  - Hittable interface allows CollisionSystem to handle any entity with mesh.position/alive/damage
  - Adding FlightInput fields is tedious — every mock input in every test file needs updating (consider a shared test helper)
  - Bomb inherits aircraft forward velocity at release for realistic parabolic trajectory
  - Radar missile is fire-and-forget — no continuous lock needed after launch (unlike heat-seeking)
  - HUD update signature changed from positional args to WeaponManager object — cleaner as weapon count grows
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-023
- What was implemented: Flare entity (mesh + particle effect, backward drift, lifetime expiry), CountermeasureSystem (alternating flare/chaff deployment, edge-triggered F key, cooldown, probabilistic missile decoying), Missile.divertToFlare() for redirecting missiles toward countermeasures, HUD shows FLR/CHF ammo counts, Game integration
- Files changed: src/Flare.ts, src/Flare.test.ts, src/CountermeasureSystem.ts, src/CountermeasureSystem.test.ts, src/Missile.ts, src/Missile.test.ts, src/InputManager.ts, src/InputManager.test.ts, src/AIInput.ts, src/Hud.ts, src/Game.ts, + 7 test files updated for deployCountermeasure field
- **Tests added:** 18 new tests (5 Flare + 10 CountermeasureSystem + 1 InputManager + 2 Missile divert), total now 294
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Missile.divertToFlare() nulls the target and sets a divertPosition — tracking code checks divertPosition first, then target
  - CountermeasureSystem alternates flare/chaff on each press — fallback to the other type if one is depleted
  - Flare decoy is probabilistic (70% for heat-seekers, 60% for radar) — use `vi.spyOn(Math, 'random')` for deterministic tests
  - Edge-triggered deploy + cooldown (0.3s) prevents spamming countermeasures
  - HUD.update() takes optional CountermeasureSystem param — backward compatible with existing callers
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-024
- What was implemented: GroundTarget entity (SAM, bunker, vehicle, radar with type-specific health/colors), SAM missile firing with cooldown and limited ammo, CollisionSystem.checkGroundTargets() for weapon-vs-ground-target collisions, ObjectiveManager destroy_ground_targets objective type, MissionData groundTargets schema, MissionLoader ground target spawning, Game integration with SAM missiles and ground kill tracking, middleeast-01 air-to-ground mission JSON
- Files changed: src/GroundTarget.ts, src/GroundTarget.test.ts, src/CollisionSystem.ts, src/CollisionSystem.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, src/MissionData.ts, src/MissionLoader.ts, src/MissionLoader.test.ts, src/ObjectiveManager.ts, src/ObjectiveManager.test.ts, public/missions/middleeast-01.json
- **Tests added:** 23 new tests (11 GroundTarget + 4 CollisionSystem + 4 ObjectiveManager + 2 MissionLoader + 2 Game), total now 317
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GroundTarget uses MeshBuilder.CreateBox (not CreateCylinder) — mock must include CreateBox
  - SAM tryFire() returns Missile[] — caller manages the missile array and updates them each frame
  - CollisionSystem.checkGroundTargets() returns destroyed indices for ObjectiveManager.recordGroundKill()
  - Refactored spawnExplosion → spawnExplosionAt(position) to reuse for ground target destruction
  - ObjectiveManager constructor takes optional 3rd param totalGroundTargets — backward compatible
  - Game.samMissiles array accumulates SAM-fired missiles; passed to countermeasureSystem for flare decoy
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-025
- What was implemented: MenuScene (main menu with New Game, Continue, Settings buttons), SettingsScene (audio volume slider, graphics quality dropdown, persistence via localStorage), main.ts updated to start with menu and route "Return to Menu" from debrief back to menu
- Files changed: src/MenuScene.ts, src/MenuScene.test.ts, src/SettingsScene.ts, src/SettingsScene.test.ts, src/main.ts
- **Tests added:** 18 new tests (8 MenuScene + 10 SettingsScene), total now 335
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SettingsScene uses separate localStorage key (`topgun_settings_v1`) to avoid coupling with SaveManager
  - `loadSettings`/`saveSettings` helpers accept injectable storage for testability (same pattern as SaveManager)
  - Menu → Settings → Back → Menu flow works cleanly with dispose/create pattern
  - DebriefScene "Return to Menu" now navigates to showMenu() for proper game flow
  - Game.samMissiles array accumulates SAM-fired missiles; passed to countermeasureSystem for flare decoy
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-027
- What was implemented: Additional test coverage validating save system acceptance criteria — auto-load on construction, theater unlock persistence across sessions, score persistence, corrupt data recovery, null field handling, empty string handling, versioned key isolation
- Files changed: src/SaveManager.test.ts, src/ProgressionManager.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 7 new tests (3 SaveManager + 4 ProgressionManager), total now 357
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Save system was already fully implemented in US-019 (SaveManager + ProgressionManager) — US-027 was primarily about validation
  - Theater unlock state is derived from completed missions rather than stored separately — avoids redundant data
  - `null` values in parsed JSON fields need explicit fallback via `??` operator (already handled in SaveManager.load)
  - Empty string in localStorage triggers JSON.parse error, which falls through to the catch block returning defaults
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-026
- What was implemented: TheaterSelectScene (HTML/CSS overlay showing 4 theaters with unlock states, expandable mission lists, completion progress), MissionManifest (static campaign data), ProgressionManager theater unlock/progress methods, main.ts flow updated to menu → theater select → briefing
- Files changed: src/TheaterSelectScene.ts, src/TheaterSelectScene.test.ts, src/MissionManifest.ts, src/ProgressionManager.ts, src/ProgressionManager.test.ts, src/main.ts
- **Tests added:** 15 new tests (10 TheaterSelectScene + 5 ProgressionManager), total now 350
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MissionManifest avoids fetching every mission JSON just to populate theater/mission select — static metadata is sufficient
  - `isTheaterUnlocked` uses chain logic: pacific/middleeast always available, europe after either is complete, arctic after europe
  - `isTheaterComplete` checks all missions in THEATER_MISSIONS array — keep this in sync with MissionManifest
  - TheaterSelectScene uses data attributes (`data-theater-id`, `data-mission-id`, `data-action`) for testable DOM queries
  - After debrief "Next Mission" now returns to theater select (not just next mission) for proper campaign navigation
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-028
- What was implemented: 4 new Pacific theater mission JSON files (pacific-02 through pacific-05), completing the 5-mission Pacific campaign
- Files changed: public/missions/pacific-02.json, public/missions/pacific-03.json, public/missions/pacific-04.json, public/missions/pacific-05.json, src/PacificMissions.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 10 new tests in src/PacificMissions.test.ts, total now 367
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Mission JSON files can be tested by importing them directly via Vite's resolveJsonModule (no fs/path needed)
  - Progressive difficulty: aiDifficulty 1→1→2→2→3 across 5 missions feels right
  - Mix objective types: destroy_enemies (count), survive_time, destroy_all keeps missions varied
  - Boss missions should have a named enemy with distinct color and diamond formation for dramatic feel
  - Same test pattern (import JSON, validate structure/progression) can be reused for other theater test files
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-029
- What was implemented: 4 new Middle East theater mission JSON files (middleeast-02 through middleeast-05), fixed middleeast-01 title to match MissionManifest
- Files changed: public/missions/middleeast-01.json, public/missions/middleeast-02.json, public/missions/middleeast-03.json, public/missions/middleeast-04.json, public/missions/middleeast-05.json, src/MiddleEastMissions.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 10 new tests in src/MiddleEastMissions.test.ts, total now 377
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MissionManifest titles must match actual mission JSON titles — middleeast-01 was "SAM Suppression" but manifest said "Desert Strike"
  - Middle East theater focuses on ground attack: majority of missions use destroy_ground_targets objective
  - Combined objectives (air + ground in same mission) make boss encounters more challenging
  - Convoy missions use vehicle ground targets in a line formation for visual storytelling
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-030
- What was implemented: 5 Europe theater mission JSON files (europe-01 through europe-05) with progressive difficulty and mixed mission types
- Files changed: public/missions/europe-01.json, public/missions/europe-02.json, public/missions/europe-03.json, public/missions/europe-04.json, public/missions/europe-05.json, src/EuropeMissions.test.ts
- **Tests added:** 10 new tests in src/EuropeMissions.test.ts, total now 387
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Europe theater uses higher starting altitudes (80-100y) to reflect high-altitude intercept theme
  - Stealth recon mission uses survive_time objective — good for variety without needing ground targets
  - Boss ace "Iron Eagle" uses blue-ish color ({r:0.3, g:0.3, b:1}) to distinguish from red enemies and Middle East orange boss
  - Same test pattern from Pacific/Middle East works directly — import JSON, validate structure/progression/variety
  - Europe-04 (Air Superiority) combines air + ground objectives for tactical variety before the boss mission
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-031
- What was implemented: Scoring module (kill/time/accuracy/damage formula), Medal system (Bronze/Silver/Gold thresholds), DebriefScene shows score and medal, TheaterSelectScene shows medal badges per mission, WeaponSystem tracks shotsFired, CollisionSystem tracks playerHitsDealt, Game computes full ScoreBreakdown at mission end, ProgressionManager delegates scoring to Scoring module and adds getMissionMedal()
- Files changed: src/Scoring.ts, src/Scoring.test.ts, src/DebriefScene.ts, src/DebriefScene.test.ts, src/ProgressionManager.ts, src/ProgressionManager.test.ts, src/TheaterSelectScene.ts, src/TheaterSelectScene.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/WeaponSystem.ts, src/CollisionSystem.ts, src/main.ts
- **Tests added:** 22 new tests (13 Scoring + 4 ProgressionManager medals + 3 DebriefScene score/medal + 1 TheaterSelectScene medal badge + 1 ProgressionManager medal persistence), total now 409
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Scoring extracted to standalone `Scoring.ts` module — keeps formula testable independently from ProgressionManager
  - `MissionResult` extended with score, medal, shotsFired, shotsHit, damageTaken — all callers must provide full object
  - `WeaponSystem.shotsFired` counter tracks gun rounds fired — used for accuracy calculation
  - `CollisionSystem.playerHitsDealt` tracks player projectile hits on enemies — used for accuracy calculation
  - Medal is derived from score at query time via `getMedal(score)` — no need to store medals separately
  - `MissionInfo.medal` field added to TheaterSelectScene — medals shown as symbols (★ gold, ☆ silver, ● bronze)
  - `makeResult()` test helper in ProgressionManager.test.ts auto-computes score/medal from parameters — reduces boilerplate
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-032
- What was implemented: BossSystem (phase transitions: Normal → Enraged → Desperate based on health), BossHealthBar (HUD element with name and colored health bar), MissionData boss fields (bossIndex, bossName, bossHealth), Game integration initializing boss on boss missions, arctic-05 boss mission JSON, updated pacific-05/middleeast-05/europe-05 with boss data
- Files changed: src/BossSystem.ts, src/BossSystem.test.ts, src/BossHealthBar.ts, src/BossHealthBar.test.ts, src/BossMissions.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, src/MissionData.ts, public/missions/pacific-05.json, public/missions/middleeast-05.json, public/missions/europe-05.json, public/missions/arctic-05.json
- **Tests added:** 50 new tests (11 BossSystem + 7 BossHealthBar + 29 BossMissions + 3 Game), total now 459
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BossSystem uses phase enum with threshold checks — cleaner than nested if/else for multi-phase state
  - `bossIndex` in MissionData identifies which enemy is the boss — keeps schema backward-compatible with optional field
  - BossHealthBar uses separate AdvancedDynamicTexture — multiple fullscreen UIs can coexist (HUD, Debug, HitFlash, BossHealth)
  - Boss health override applied in Game constructor before BossSystem.init() captures maxHealth
  - Arctic boss "Nemesis" has 500 HP (highest) — progressive difficulty across theaters: 300/350/400/500
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-033
- What was implemented: AssetLoader module for GLTF model loading with caching and fallback, modelPath field in AircraftStats/aircraft.json, 3 low-poly GLB placeholder models (F-14, P-51, F/A-18), Game.loadModels() for transparent mesh replacement, @babylonjs/loaders dependency
- Files changed: src/AssetLoader.ts, src/AssetLoader.test.ts, src/AircraftData.ts, src/Game.ts, src/main.ts, public/data/aircraft.json, public/models/f-14.glb, public/models/p-51.glb, public/models/fa-18.glb, package.json
- **Tests added:** 7 new tests in src/AssetLoader.test.ts (load, cache, catalog preload, mesh replacement, fallback), total now 466
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GLTF meshes are bound to the Scene they're loaded into — must use Game's scene, not a temporary one
  - SceneLoader.ImportMeshAsync returns meshes[0] as root mesh — use it for position/rotation
  - applyModel pattern: save old position, dispose old mesh, assign new, restore position
  - Generated GLB files with raw binary approach (no extra dependencies) for placeholder geometry
  - `vi.hoisted()` is essential for mock functions used inside `vi.mock()` factory callbacks
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-034
- What was implemented: AudioManager with engine loop (throttle-based pitch modulation via setPlaybackRate), weapon SFX (gun fire, missile launch, explosion), spatial audio for enemy engines (attachToMesh with distance attenuation), master volume control, Game integration tracking shotsFired/missile counts for SFX triggers
- Files changed: src/AudioManager.ts, src/AudioManager.test.ts, src/Game.ts, src/Game.test.ts, public/audio/engine-loop.mp3, public/audio/gunfire.mp3, public/audio/missile-launch.mp3, public/audio/explosion.mp3
- **Tests added:** 14 new tests (12 AudioManager + 2 Game), total now 480
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Babylon.js `Sound` uses `setPlaybackRate()` not a `playbackRate` property — check API before assuming
  - Detect firing events by comparing prev/current counters (shotsFired, missile array length) — no callback needed
  - Spatial audio: `spatialSound: true` + `attachToMesh()` handles distance attenuation automatically
  - Placeholder MP3 files (minimal binary) don't crash Babylon — graceful degradation
  - Engine pitch formula: `0.6 + throttle * 1.2` maps 0-1 throttle to 0.6-1.8 playback rate
  - MockSound needs `setPlaybackRate` method in Game.test.ts mock
